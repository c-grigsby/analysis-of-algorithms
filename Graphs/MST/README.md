## Minimum Search Tree (MST) Implementation

Use Primsâ€™ Algorithm to create a MST for the given matrix

Input: a graph represented as an adjacency matrix, where index 0 is A, index 1 is B, etc.
```
input = [
[0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 10, 2, 18, 0, 0],
[5, 10, 0, 3, 0, 16, 0],
[0, 2, 3, 0, 12, 30, 14],
[0, 18, 0, 12, 0, 0, 4],
[0, 0, 16, 30, 0, 0, 26],
[0, 0, 0, 14, 4, 26, 0]
]
```
Output: a list of tuples, wherein each tuple represents an edge of the MST as (v1, v2,
weight) 
- For example: output = [(0, 2, 5), (2, 3, 3), (3, 1, 2), (3, 4, 12), (2, 5, 16), (4, 6, 4)]

Note: the order of edge tuples within the output does not matter; additionally, the
order of vertices within each edge does not matter. For example, another valid
output would be below (v1 and v2 in the first edge are flip-flopped; the last two
edges in the list are flip-flopped).

output = [(2, 0, 5), (2, 3, 3), (3, 1, 2), (3, 4, 12), (4, 6, 4), (2, 5, 16)]
