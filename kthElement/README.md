# KthElement

Implement an algorithm using divide and conquer technique: Given two sorted arrays of 
size m and n respectively, find the element that would be at the kth position in combined 
sorted array. 

a. Write a pseudocode/describe your strategy for a function kthelement(Arr1, Arr2, k) 
that uses the concepts mentioned in the divide and conquer technique. The function 
would take two sorted arrays Arr1, Arr2 and position k as input and returns the 
element at the kth position in the combined sorted array. 

b. Implement the function kthElement(Arr1, Arr2, k) that was written in part a. Name 
your file KthElement.py 

Examples: 
Arr1 = [1,2,3,5,6] ; Arr2= [3,4,5,6,7] ; k= 5 
Returns: 4 
Explanation: 5th element in the combined sorted array [1,2,3,3,4,5,5,6,6,7] is 4 

Any tips for tracing through recursive algos by hand general (besides a recursion-tree)? I sometimes find that it is not always straight forward, but maybe it's just me. Maybe the best way is just to use a debugger as shown?
