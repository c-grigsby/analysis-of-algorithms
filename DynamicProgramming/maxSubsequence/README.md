### Solve Dynamic Programming Problem and find its optimal solution.

Given a list of numbers, return a subsequence of non-consecutive numbers in the form of a
list that would have the maximum sum. When the numbers are all negatives your code
should return []

Example 1: Input: [7,2,5,8,6]

Output: [7,5,6] (This will have sum of 18)

Example 2: Input: [-1, -1, 0]

Output: [0] (This is the maximum possible sum for this array)

Example 3: Input: [-1, -1, -10, -34]

Output: []
 
- Part a) Implement the solution of this problem using dynamic Programming. Name your
function max_independent_set(nums). Name your file MaxSet.py
- Part b) What is the time complexity of your implementation?
