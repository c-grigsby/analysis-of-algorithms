You are playing a puzzle. A random number N is given, you have blocks of length 1 unit and 2
units. You need to arrange the blocks back to back such that you get a total length of N units. In
how many distinct ways can you arrange the blocks for given N.

a. Write a description/pseudocode of approach to solve it using Dynamic Programming
paradigm (either top-down or bottom-up approach)

b. Write pseudocode/description for the brute force approach

c. Compare the time complexity of both the approaches

d. Write the recurrence formula for the problem

Example 1:

Input: N=2, Result: 2

Explanation: There are two ways. (1+1 , 2)

Example 2:

Input: N=3, Result: 3

Explanation: There are three ways (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1)
